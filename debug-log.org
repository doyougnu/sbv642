#+description: A log of what was tried and what happened

* Initial Description
We have a ~sbv~ program that is 10x slower when compiled campared to when
run in interpreted mode. For example:
    #+begin_src
Wed Mar  1 01:12:50 PM UTC 2023 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4
Wed Mar  1 01:12:50 PM UTC 2023 Running compiled version
Wed Mar  1 01:12:51 PM UTC 2023 [1 of 1] Compiling Issue642         ( Issue642.hs, Issue642.o )

Wed Mar  1 01:12:51 PM UTC 2023 Compiled, running

Wed Mar  1 01:55:05 PM UTC 2023 Interpreted, running

Wed Mar  1 01:56:53 PM UTC 2023 Done
    #+end_src

compare 44 minutes to 1 minute 47 seconds

* Hypotheses

** This is a GHC regression

** Test
Tested with GHC 8.8, 8.10, 9.2

** Result
Same behavior observed for each GHC
